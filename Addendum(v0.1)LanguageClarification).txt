Addendum (v0.1 Language Clarification)

Note on terminology:
This document uses the term entropy in a domain-specific, computational sense rather than the strict physical or Shannon-theoretic definition. Throughout v0.1, “entropy” refers to unresolved cognitive load, latent complexity, or structural friction within an intelligent system, not thermodynamic disorder.

The architecture described here is a cognitive/computational model, not a physical theory. The terminology emerged organically during development and will be aligned with standard cognitive-science and systems-engineering language in v0.2.

Future revisions will:

replace metaphor-heavy phrasing with precise technical terms

distinguish clearly between physical entropy and cognitive-load entropy

provide citations, mappings, and formal definitions across domains

maintain conceptual continuity while tightening scientific framing

The underlying mechanisms, operators, and architectural components remain unchanged; only the vocabulary will be standardized for clarity and interoperability with existing research fields.
