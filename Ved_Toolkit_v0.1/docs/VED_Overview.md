# Vectorized Entropic Decomposition (VED)
## Overview

Vectorized Entropic Decomposition (VED) is a formal framework for analyzing how a system distributes, routes, and resolves disorder across multiple expression channels. It provides measurable quantities for capacity, routing cost, load distribution, resolution efficiency, and failure dynamics. VED is domain-agnostic: it applies to cognitive systems, computational agents, biological processes, and engineered workflows.

The purpose of VED is to:
1. Quantify how a system handles multi-dimensional workload.
2. Model how entropy propagates through constrained channels.
3. Identify systematic patterns of overload and collapse.
4. Evaluate the efficiency of routing strategies.
5. Predict resolution pathways and failure points.

VED does not characterize subjective experience or psychological states. It characterizes structural behavior of any system that must process tasks with varying complexity and cost.
