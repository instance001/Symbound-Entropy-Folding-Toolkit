# Vectorized Entropic Decomposition (VED)
## Formal Definitions

This document specifies the formal mathematical structure of the VED framework.

System tuple:
    S = (C, T, R, O, Φ)

Where:
- C: capacity vector
- T: set of tasks
- R: routing mechanism
- O: outcome space
- Φ: transition operator from tasks to outcomes
