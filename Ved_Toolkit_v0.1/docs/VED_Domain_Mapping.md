# VED Domain Mapping

This file summarizes how core VED quantities (capacity, demand, routing, outcome)
map to multiple domains: cognitive, AI, engineering, computational, biological, and organizational.

For each domain, define:
- Capacity dimensions
- Demand vectors
- Routing structure
- Outcome interpretation
