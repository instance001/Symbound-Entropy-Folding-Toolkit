# VED Limitations and Assumptions

VED v0.1 assumes:
- Finite, non-negative capacity vectors
- Vectorizable tasks
- Deterministic routing
- Deterministic outcome classification
- Domain-defined entropy contribution

Temporal dynamics, probabilistic routing, and multi-agent interactions
are left for future extensions.
