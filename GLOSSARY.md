## Symbound-Entropy-Folding-Toolkit
| Term | Alternate term(s) | Alt map | External map | Relation to existing terminology | What it is | What it is not | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Entropy Folding (whitepaper v0.1) | EF | ~ | ~ | Lawful entropy redirection model | Defines folding operator F(E) that preserves total entropy while redistributing spatially, temporally, and modally; introduces vaults, routing cost R, metabolic capacity M(t) | Not entropy reduction; not violation of thermodynamics | Symbound-Entropy-Folding-Toolkit/Entropy_Folding.txt |
| Entropy Vault (EF context) | vault | ~ | ~ | Deferred entropy reservoir | Structured reservoir storing unresolved entropy to prevent active-space collapse | Not lossless compression claim; not energy creation | Symbound-Entropy-Folding-Toolkit/Entropy_Folding.txt |
| Routing Cost (R) | routing cost | = | ~ | Friction term | Energy/friction required to route around entropy expression during folding | Not free; must be budgeted | Symbound-Entropy-Folding-Toolkit/Entropy_Folding.txt |
| Metabolic Capacity M(t) | capacity | ~ | ~ | Processing capacity | Time-varying ability to process stored entropy; folding stabilizes when M(t+Δt) > M(t) | Not fixed; not guaranteed to increase | Symbound-Entropy-Folding-Toolkit/Entropy_Folding.txt |
