🧠 Symbound Cognitive Glossary (v0.2-Ready)

Clarified, domain-aligned definitions for all major terms.

🔵 CORE CONCEPTS
Cognitive Entropy

A system’s unresolved complexity, latent cognitive load, or structural friction.
Represents tasks, thoughts, problems, or states that require processing but are not yet integrated.

Not thermodynamic entropy — a computational load variable.

Vaulting (Cognitive Vault)

A structured mechanism for deferring high-cost problems into a safe latent state until the system reorganizes enough to resolve them.

Equivalent concepts:

deferred computation

asynchronous problem buffering

working-memory offloading

latent-space holding

Entropy Folding

The system’s ability to redirect unresolved complexity (cognitive entropy) into alternative spatial, temporal, or modal expressions that prevent overload.

Equivalent to:

load balancing

reframing

cognitive routing

structural deferral

schema reorganization

Transformation Pathways

How a cognitive system converts unresolved material into:

new abstractions

new schemas

new problem frames

new tools or insights

This is the engine of conceptual growth.

Cognitive Collapse

A failure mode where incoming load exceeds the system’s ability to route, vault, or transform it.

Examples:

overwhelm

reasoning breakdown

rumination loops

LLM hallucination under strain

Failure Metabolism

The system’s ability to convert failures into structural improvements rather than damage.

Equivalent to:

error-driven learning

meta-cognitive resilience

gradient signal reuse

antifragile behavior

🔵 TEMPORAL MECHANISMS
TAEP (Temporal Asymmetry of Entropy Processing)

The system resolves many problems later, after internal structure evolves.

Equivalent to:

incubation effects

delayed insight

consolidation

successive approximation

Temporal Deferral

The deliberate postponing of high friction tasks to avoid collapse.

This is computationally equivalent to:

scheduling

queuing

batch processing

🔵 COGNITIVE AGENTS
Foreman (Executive Agent)

A planning-level controller that:

structures tasks

assigns work

tracks dependencies

ensures coherence

Equivalent to:

meta-reasoning controller

executive-function layer

scheduler

Worker (Generative Agent)

A creative / generative subsystem responsible for:

exploration

proposal generation

solution attempts

Equivalent to:

generative model

creative cognition

synthesis engine

Janet (MCM – Modest Cognition Model)

A deterministic supervisor that:

enforces constraints

prevents drift

validates structure

checks reasoning integrity

Equivalent to:

formal verifier

constraint satisfaction kernel

metacognitive safety layer

deterministic cognitive scaffold

This is one of the strongest architectural contributions.

🔵 INFORMATION STRUCTURES
Cognitive Spine (MemorySpine)

A structured externalized memory system containing:

stable abstractions

persistent patterns

long-term knowledge structures

Equivalent to:

schema graph

knowledge backbone

cognitive ontology

Patina (Cognitive Patina)

Behavioral refinement accumulated through repeated interactions.

Equivalent to:

iterative fine-tuning

adaptive heuristics

meta-learning

Load Window

The system’s effective working-memory bandwidth at a given moment.

Equivalent to:

cognitive capacity

mental bandwidth

task-channel width

🔵 PATHWAYS & ROUTING
Routing

The process of deciding where a cognitive task should go:

resolve now

route to a buffer

convert into a different form

defer to vault

Equivalent to:

computational routing

meta-level decision control

Spatial Folding

Redirecting cognitive load into different representational areas.

Equivalent to:

conceptual reframing

schema switching

domain transfer

Modal Folding

Transforming high-load content into a different modality that reduces friction (e.g., from verbal to spatial).

Equivalent to:

encoding shift

abstraction shift

multimodal reformatting

Vault Pressure

The accumulated load in deferred states.

Equivalent to:

backlog pressure

queue weight

latent complexity

🔵 SYSTEM BEHAVIOR
Stability Curve

A representation of the system’s ability to stay coherent under increasing load.

Equivalent to:

cognitive robustness profile

performance degradation curve

Insight Rut

When the system delays too many tasks, preventing resolution from ever occurring.

Equivalent to:

deferral deadlock

analysis paralysis

Entropy Leak

When unresolved complexity escapes the vault and disrupts active processing.

Equivalent to:

buffer overflow

unbounded recursion

rumination spillover

🔵 META-SYSTEMS
Cognitive Genome Project

A structured method for mapping an individual’s cognitive architecture:

recursion patterns

abstraction ladders

representational preferences

friction zones

Equivalent to:

cognitive topology map

structural cognition profile
